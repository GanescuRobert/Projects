For CppConference:
    
    The program uses 3 txt files.
    -conferences seen.txt remember the title of all conferences you have seen
    -urlIn.txt stores video links for future viewing
    -urlOut.txt stores links to videos you've seen

    The lines correspond. (the title on the first line, from the first txt, has as a link the first line from the 3rd txt)
    To reset just delete the urlOut files and seen conferences.
    The program works from any location, provided you change the path of the files inside the program.
    To use the program enter:
    C: \ ... \ CPPconferences \ bin \ Release + .exe -> CPPconferences.exe
    
    The program take a link from a file, open it on internet, search for title and store the title and the original url in different files. In case you have the title in your "viewed list", the program will take the next link.
    
    I developt this program because all of this conferences have lots of reference links to other videos, so to make my life easier, i thought that will be a good ideea to make a program which store all of it.
